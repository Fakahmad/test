# test
My first repo to test, try and learn diff features of Github
So I am watching a video on YouTube to learn github and while watching, I am also doing the actions described there.
Heres the link to the viode https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk

I will use git to try to upload some of my python assignments, works and projects.

Now this is the line I am adding after saving it once.

Making changes after cloning from github to my laptop
This change I am making on github wensite and then I will try to pull the latest file to my local repo and
see if changes appear and try to merge them with my local copy of README file in this path
C:\Users\Farooq\Farooqs Laptop folder\Git_test_Repo\myproject\test>
