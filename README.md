# test
My first repo to test, try and learn diff features of Github
So I am watching a video on YouTube to learn github and while watching, I am also doing the actions described there.
Heres the link to the viode https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk

I will use git to try to upload some of my python assignments, works and projects.

Now this is the line I am adding after saving it once.

Making changes after cloning from github to my laptop
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This change I am making on github wensite and then I will try to pull the latest file to my local repo and
see if changes appear and try to merge them with my local copy of README file in this path
C:\Users\Farooq\Farooqs Laptop folder\Git_test_Repo\myproject\test>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So i made changes in this file and committed and then pulled it from local git directory and the changes done on 
website got merged with the file on my local directory, so all good.
Now I will make changes on website and commit, and fetch this file from laptop which should copy to my laptop and not
merge with the copy that i have so that I use use the git merge command to merge it manually. So these last few lines are those changes
